                            use our analytics provider to measure the number of page views on our website in aggregate
                            and
                            the sources

                                    the slack user ID and team ID - allows us to associate your use of our Slack

                                    name of your slack team (e.g. Douglas Technologies) - provided automatically by

                            big text only stores Slack user IDs, team IDs and access tokens. we do not store your
                            display name or email address. we additionally do not request permissions from Slack that
                            would
                            enable us to later request personal information about you. big text does not have read
                            access to any
                            Slack conversations, DMs, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            information we collect is not shared with any 3rd parties under any circumstance.

                        <li>
                            at your request, big text will delete the stored access tokens. such requests may be made by
                            emailing
                            privacy@dougie.tech you may also revoke your
                            authorization
                            directly through Slack, which renders the tokens we have invalid.

                        <li>
                            because big text does not associate the creator of an image with the image itself, we cannot
                            honor request to delete
                            all images created by a particular user.
